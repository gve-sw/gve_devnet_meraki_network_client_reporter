## Prerequisites
#### Meraki API Keys
In order to use the Meraki API, you need to enable the API for your organization first. After enabling API access, you can generate an API key. Follow these instructions to enable API access and generate an API key:
1. Login to the Meraki dashboard
2. In the left-hand menu, navigate to `Organization > Settings > Dashboard API access`
3. Click on `Enable access to the Cisco Meraki Dashboard API`
4. Go to `My Profile > API access`
5. Under API access, click on `Generate API key`
6. Save the API key in a safe place. The API key will only be shown once for security purposes, so it is very important to take note of the key then. In case you lose the key, then you have to revoke the key and a generate a new key. Moreover, there is a limit of only two API keys per profile.
